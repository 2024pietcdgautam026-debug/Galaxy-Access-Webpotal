            <p>The universe is everything, including space, matter, energy, time, and all their contents. Space is the void between celestial objects, while the universe is the totality of all that exists. Here are some more details about space and the universe:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Size:</strong> The universe is incredibly large, and its exact size is unknown because we can't see its edge. The visible universe is at least 93 billion light years across, and it's estimated that the universe is at least $1.5 \times 10^{34}$ light-years in size.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Expansion:</strong> The universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, which occurred $13.787$ billion years ago.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Composition:</strong> Space is filled with radiation, magnetic fields, and high energy particles. The space between stars and galaxies is mostly empty, but it does contain some dust particles and hydrogen atoms.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Exploration:</strong> Humans have begun exploring space, but it's a challenging environment. The hazards of radiation and vacuum, as well as microgravity, make space exploration difficult.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Theoretical models:</strong> Some theoretical models of the universe include the Big Bang model, the general theory of relativity, and the multiverse hypothesis.</p>
