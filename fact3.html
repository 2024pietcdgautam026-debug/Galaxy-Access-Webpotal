    <h1>A Neutron Star Is So Dense a Sugar Cube Would Weigh a Billion Tons</h1>
    <p class="article-meta">Category: Stellar Physics</p>

    <p class="article-text">
        Neutron stars are formed when massive stars explode in supernovae
        and their cores collapse under intense gravity.
    </p>

    <p class="article-text">
        These stars pack more mass than the Sun into a sphere
        roughly <b>20 kilometers</b> wide. Because of this extreme density,
        a sugar-cube-sized piece of neutron star material would weigh
        about <b>one billion tons</b> on Earth.
    </p>

    <p class="article-text">
        Studying neutron stars helps scientists understand matter
        under extreme pressure and test the laws of physics.
