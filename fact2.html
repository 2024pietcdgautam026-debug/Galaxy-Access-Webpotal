    <h1>One Day on Venus Is Longer Than a Year</h1>
    <p class="article-meta">Category: Planetary Science</p>

    <p class="article-text">
        Venus has one of the most unusual time cycles in our solar system.
        A single rotation on its axis takes longer than its orbit around the Sun.
    </p>

    <p class="article-text">
        One day on Venus lasts about <b>243 Earth days</b>, while one year on Venus
        is only about <b>225 Earth days</b>. This happens because Venus rotates
        extremely slowly compared to other planets.
    </p>

    <p class="article-text">
        Venus also rotates in the opposite direction to most planets,
        meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.
